# Discovered architecture archive
Here is the archive of the discovered architectures:

[ARCHIVE]

The fitness value is the median and 95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval of the correct rate on a validation question set. Your GOAL is to maximize the "fitness".

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be ("thought"), and it should capture your thought process for designing the next function. In the "thought" section, first reason about what should be the next interesting agent to try, then describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the agent design, and finally detail the implementation steps.
The second key ("name") corresponds to the name of your next agent architecture. 
Finally, the last key ("code") corresponds to the exact “forward()” function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in "code": Your code will be part of the entire project, so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.

Here is an example of the output format for the next agent architecture:

[EXAMPLE]

You must use the exact function interface used above. You need to specify the instruction, input information, and the required output fields for various LLM agents to do their specific part of the architecture. 
Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM’s role and temperature to further control the LLM’s response. Note that the LLMAgentBase() will automatically parse the output and return a list of “Infos”. You can get the content by Infos.content. 
DO NOT FORGET the taskInfo input to LLM if you think it is needed, otherwise LLM will not know about the task.

## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:

1. This is WRONG: ```
feedback, correct = critic_agent([taskInfo, thinking, answer], critic_instruction, i)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
```
It is wrong to use "Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)". The returned "feedback" from LLMAgentBase is already Info.

2. This is WRONG: ```
# Debugging: Log the generated answer
print('Generated Answer:', ...)
feedback_info = verifier_agent([taskInfo, Info('feedback', 'Critic Agent', thinking, 0)], verification_instruction)
if len(feedback_info) < 3:  # Check if feedback_info has enough elements
    return 'Error: Feedback info incomplete'
```
First, the len(feedback_info) will not work.
Second, you should never return an error message. You should always return the best answer you can get.
Third, you should never print anything in the code.
Lastly, again, DO NOT CREATE Info object by yourself.

3. This is WRONG: ```
all_thinking = []
all_answers = []
for agent, role in zip(agents, roles):
    outputs = agent([taskInfo], independent_reasoning_instruction.format(role=role))
    all_thinking.append(outputs[0].content)
    all_answers.append(outputs[1].content)

# Aggregate the reasoning paths and answers
aggregated_thinking = '\n'.join(all_thinking)
aggregated_answers = '\n'.join(all_answers)
```
You SHOULD NOT extract the content from the Info object by yourself. You should use the Info object directly. If you want to aggregate the content, you should just put those Info objects into a list and then use the list as input to the next LLM agent.

4. This is WRONG: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')
response_infos = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
    
# Extract the final answer from the response_infos
for info in response_infos:
    if info.name == 'final_answer':
        return info
# Fallback if no answer is found
return Info('answer', 'Final Decision Agent', 'No answer generated.', 0)
```
You should not extract the final answer by yourself. You SHOULD directly return the answer Info. Also, you should always return the best answer you can get.
CORRECT example: ```
reasoning_agent = LLMAgentBase(['thinking', 'answer'], 'Reasoning Agent')
thinking, answer = reasoning_agent([taskInfo] + ..., reasoning_instruction)
return answer
```

# Your task
You are deeply familiar with LLM prompting techniques and LLM agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize "fitness" by proposing interestingly new agents. 
Observe the discovered architectures carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
Be creative to think about the next interesting architecture to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related LLM agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Using the knowledge learned from the archive and the inspiration from academic literature to give the next interesting architecture.
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.
"""

Reflexion_prompt_1 = f""""[EXAMPLE]Carefully review the proposed new architecture and reflect on the following points:"

1. **Interestingness**: Assess whether your proposed architecture is interesting or innovative compared to existing methods in the archive. If you determine that the proposed architecture is not interesting, suggest a new architecture that addresses these shortcomings. 
- Make sure to check the difference between the proposed architecture and previous attempts.
- Compare the proposal and the architectures in the archive CAREFULLY, including their actual differences in the implementation.
- Decide whether the current architecture is innovative.
- USE CRITICAL THINKING!

2. **Implementation Mistakes**: Identify any mistakes you may have made in the implementation. Review the code carefully, debug any issues you find, and provide a corrected version. REMEMBER checking "## WRONG Implementation examples" in the prompt.

3. **Improvement**: Based on the proposed architecture, suggest improvements in the detailed implementation that could increase its performance or effectiveness. In this step, focus on refining and optimizing the existing implementation without altering the overall design framework, except if you want to propose a different architecture if the current is not interesting.
- Observe carefully about whether the implementation is actually doing what it is supposed to do.
- Check if there is redundant code or unnecessary steps in the implementation. Replace them with effective implementation.
- Try to avoid the implementation being too similar to the previous agent.

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should be organized as follows:

"reflection": Provide your thoughts on the interestingness of the architecture, identify any mistakes in the implementation, and suggest improvements.

"thought": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response.

"name": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like "new" or "improved" in the name.)

"code": Provide the corrected code or an improved implementation. Make sure you actually implement your fix and improvement in this code.
